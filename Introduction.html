            <h1>Introduction to My Project</h1>
            <p>This project will showcases the work I have done throughout the course. The goal is to highlight the various stages of my learning and development, from initial concepts to final projects.</p>
            <p>This semster we were tasked with writing an intial report with the topic of our choice. This topic would be used for all future assignments in our class. Due to my background in tech, 
                I chose to use that as my perminant area of study.</p>
            <p> First we showcase the report which is about how technology has changed the world. Following this we will display the direcion set, where ironically, the topic was all a person would need to 
                to create a website. This will be followed by of the more significantly extensive assignments we had which is the textbook assignment. My textbook was titled, Digital Foundations, Mastering Number Systems 
                fundemental to computing. After this we did one of the more interesting projects of the semester, the instructional video and its corresponding script. My video topic was based on teaching people what 
                what they would need to remove and change an iphone screen if it were to be broken. Lastly, we have this website. which you can see for your self.   </p>
